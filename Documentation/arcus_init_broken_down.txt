HSPD 24000
	Sets the high speed in pulses per second.
	Maximum value for high speed is 6M
LSPD 9600
	Sets the low speed in pulses per second.
	Maximum value for high speed is 6M
ACCEL 300
	Sets the acceleration time in milliseconds.
	Acceleration time is the time to ramp from low speed to high speed.
	If the high speed and low speed are close, actual acceleration time can be less than set
	acceleration time.
INC
	Set the move mode to incremental mode. All the moves issued after are considered
	incremental move commands.
	If this command is a part of motion program, it sets the mode to incremental for that
	program only.
